# Smart-Task-Manager-Trello-Project
Welcome to my Smart Task Manager App project!   I used Trello to build a smart and organized system for task management.   This project helped me learn how to apply project management tools and make workflows more efficient.  
## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create a **task manager** that can handle priorities, track progress, and make teamwork easier.  
Trello helped me stay organized and made the entire process productive and interactive.  

## ✅ What I Did in Trello
✨ **Key Features of My Board:**  
- 🎯 **Labels** → Priorities like `High 🔴`, `Medium 🟡`, `Low 🟢`, plus categories `Build`, `Grow`, `Harvest`  
- 📋 **Checklists** → Step-by-step breakdown for tasks  
- 🔌 **Power-Ups** → Calendar, Card Aging, Google Drive, Maps, Voting  
- 🤖 **Butler Automation** → Auto-update completion %, bug count tracking  
- 📊 **Dashboard** → Visual progress tracking with metrics  
- 🤝 **Collaboration Tools** → Card linking, comments, file attachments, code snippets
